## 💡 **SOPHISTICATED SIMULATION APPROACH**

### **Creating Realistic Bad Sector Scenarios**

#### **Method 1: dm-dust Integration**
```bash
# Create bad sector patterns that mirror real drive failures
echo "512 1024" > /sys/block/dm-X/dm/dust/add_block  # Add bad sectors
echo "2048 4096 disable" > /sys/block/dm-X/dm/dust/add_block  # Intermittent failures
```

#### **Method 2: Software Error Injection**
```c
// In dm-remap code, add configurable error injection
if (simulate_bad_sectors && sector_in_bad_list(sector)) {
    bio->bi_status = BLK_STS_IOERR;
    bio_endio(bio);
    return DM_MAPIO_SUBMITTED;
}
```

#### **Method 3: Realistic Failure Patterns**
- **Progressive Degradation**: Simulate sectors getting worse over time
- **Thermal Cycles**: Simulate temperature-related failures
- **Wear Patterns**: Simulate SSD wear-based failures
- **Power Loss**: Simulate power failure scenarios
