# Quick Reference: Hot Path vs Error Recovery Path

## One-Liner Answer

**"Hot path" is code that runs on EVERY operation (fast must-have).**  
**"Error recovery path" is code that runs RARELY when errors occur (safety must-have).**

---

## Two Paths Through dm-remap

### 🔥 HOT PATH (Normal Operations - 99.99%)
```
Application I/O Request
    ↓
dm-remap: Table lookup
    ├─ "Is sector remapped?" → Usually NO
    ├─ Latency: 1-10 microseconds ← MUST be ultra-fast
    ├─ Frequency: Millions per second
    └─ Send to main/spare device
```

**Impact**: Every I/O operation uses this → affects system performance directly

---

### 🆘 ERROR RECOVERY PATH (When Bad Sectors Found - 0.01%)
```
Application I/O Request
    ↓
dm-remap: Table lookup
    ├─ "Is sector remapped?" → Initially NO
    └─ Send to main device
    ↓
Main device: ❌ I/O ERROR (bad sector detected)
    ↓
dm-remap Error Handler
    ├─ Determine spare location
    ├─ ⏱️ Write metadata (5 copies with fsync)
    ├─ Latency: 7.6 milliseconds ← OK for errors
    ├─ Frequency: Once per bad sector (maybe monthly)
    └─ Redirect I/O to spare device
```

**Impact**: Rare operation, doesn't affect normal performance

## The Data

| Aspect | Hot Path | Error Path |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Runs** | On EVERY I/O | Once per bad sector |
| **Frequency** | Millions/second | Once a month (maybe) |
| **Latency** | 1-10 μs | 7.6 ms |
| **Speed matters?** | YES CRITICAL | NO OK |
| **Current code** | Remap table lookup | Metadata write (5 copies) |
| **Could optimize to** | 1-2 μs (2-5x faster) | 5-6 ms (barely faster) |
| **Annual benefit if optimized** | Hours saved/year | Microseconds saved/year |
| **Risk of optimization** | LOW (lookup safe) | HIGH (could lose data) |
| **ROI** | EXCELLENT | TERRIBLE |

## Why 7.6ms is Actually a Feature

The 7.6ms is spent on:
- Writing 5 copies of metadata (for redundancy)
- Using dm-bufio (kernel safety library)
- Fsyncing to disk (so it survives power loss)

This is **INTENTIONAL DESIGN**, not a bug:

**If we tried to make it faster:**
- Remove redundancy → Data could be lost
- Skip fsync → Power loss = data loss
- Less safety checking → Undetected failures

**Result**: Saving 1-2ms on rare errors isn't worth the data loss risk.

## Where Performance Optimization MATTERS

✅ **Worth optimizing:** Hot path table lookups
- Happens millions of times per second
- Could use hash table instead of linear search
- Would save hours of user time per year
- Low risk (looking up data is safe)

❌ **Not worth optimizing:** Error recovery metadata writes
- Happens once per bad sector
- Could save ~2ms per rare error
- Would save microseconds per year
- High risk (could cause data loss)

---

## The Bottom Line

**The phrase "dm-remap is error recovery, not the hot path" means:**

> The 7.6ms latency we measured only occurs when bad sectors are detected.
> This is the error recovery path, which:
> - Happens rarely (weeks/months apart)
> - Doesn't affect normal I/O performance
> - Correctly prioritizes safety over speed
> - Is NOT a performance concern

> The actual performance bottleneck is the hot path (table lookups),
> which happens on every operation and should be optimized instead.

## Real-World Comparison

**Hospital Analogy:**

| Regular Checkup | Emergency Room |
|---|---|
| Happens: Constantly | Happens: Rarely |
| Should be fast | Can be slow (it's an emergency!) |
| Optimize here! | Don't optimize this |
| Could speed up by 10% | Could speed up by 90% |
| Saves hours/year | Saves nothing/year |
| Safe to optimize | Risky to optimize |

**dm-remap is the same:**
- Regular table lookups = Checkup (optimize for speed)
- Error recovery metadata = Emergency room (keep it safe)

## TL;DR

- **Hot path**: Fast lookups (microseconds) on every operation = OPTIMIZE THIS
- **Error path**: Safe metadata writes (milliseconds) on rare errors = DON'T OPTIMIZE
- **7.6ms is intentional**: Provides data safety, worth the latency for errors
- **Current design is correct**: Safety prioritized where it matters

Done. ✅
