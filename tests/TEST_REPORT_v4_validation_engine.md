- **Checksum error generates suggestions:** PASS - "Load backup copy or use auto-repair"
- **Device error generates suggestions:** PASS - "Reconnect device or use fuzzy matching"
- **Multiple errors generate comprehensive suggestions:** PASS - Combined guidance for complex failures

**Recovery Suggestion Categories:**
- **Critical Errors:** Backup metadata recovery (magic, version, size)
- **Integrity Errors:** Auto-repair or backup restoration (CRC mismatches)
- **Device Errors:** Reconnection, fuzzy matching, path updates (device changes)
- **Configuration Errors:** Device availability, overlap resolution (target/spare issues)

### 6. ✅ Comprehensive Validation Workflow
**Purpose:** Test end-to-end validation process integration
- **Complete workflow validation passes:** PASS - All validation steps execute successfully
- **No errors reported:** PASS - Clean metadata validates without issues
- **Validation flags indicate success:** PASS - Result flags = 0x00000000

**Workflow Integration Steps:**
1. **Structure Validation** - Basic metadata format verification
2. **Integrity Validation** - CRC32 checksum verification  
3. **Target Validation** - Device configuration and overlap checking
4. **Spare Validation** - Spare device size and fingerprint validation
5. **Result Aggregation** - Error counting and flag consolidation
