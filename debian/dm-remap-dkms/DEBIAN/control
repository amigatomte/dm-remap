Description: Device Mapper Remapping Target - DKMS source package for kernel compilation
 dm-remap is a Linux kernel device-mapper target that provides transparent
 block remapping from a primary device to a spare device. It enables:
 .
 - Unlimited remaps (4.2+ billion, up from 16,384)
 - O(1) performance (~8 microsecond lookups)
 - Automatic scaling (hash table resizes dynamically)
 - Transparent operation (no application changes needed)
 - Production ready (fully validated and tested)
 .
 This package contains the DKMS source code for dm-remap. The module will be
 automatically compiled and installed for each installed kernel at installation
 time and when new kernels are installed.
