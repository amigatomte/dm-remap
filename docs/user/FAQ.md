# dm-remap FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

---

## Installation & Setup

**Q: What are the system requirements?**  
A: Linux kernel 5.10+, device mapper support, 100+ MB free disk space, build tools (gcc, make).

**Q: Can I install dm-remap on Docker/containers?**  
A: Yes, but the module needs to be built for the host kernel. See Installation Guide for Dockerfile example.

**Q: Does dm-remap work with older Linux versions?**  
A: Minimum is Linux 5.10. Older kernels may not have necessary device mapper APIs.

**Q: Do I need root/sudo to use dm-remap?**  
A: Yes, loading modules and creating devices requires root access.

---

## Functionality

**Q: Can I use dm-remap on top of encrypted devices (dm-crypt)?**  
A: Yes! dm-remap works with other device mapper targets. Stack them: crypt → remap → physical device.

**Q: Can I layer multiple dm-remap targets?**  
A: Not recommended. A single dm-remap device handles unlimited remaps efficiently.

**Q: What happens if a remap block fails?**  
A: The module handles it transparently. Module detects failure and logs it. Data remains accessible through the spare pool.

**Q: Can I use SSDs and HDDs together (mixed)?**  
A: Yes, but performance will be limited by the slower device. Consider speed compatibility.

**Q: Does dm-remap support trim/discard?**  
A: This is planned for v4.3. Current version doesn't support discard operations.

---

## Remapping

**Q: How many remaps can I add?**  
A: Unlimited - up to 4,294,967,295 remaps (UINT32_MAX). v4.2.2 increased from previous limit of 16,384.

**Q: Can I remove or modify remaps?**  
A: Current version doesn't support removal. To reset, recreate the device. Remap removal feature coming in v4.3.

**Q: What's the latency for a remap lookup?**  
A: ~8 microseconds, constant regardless of remap count (O(1) guaranteed).

**Q: How does the hash table resizing work?**  
A: Automatic! Resizes when load factor > 1.5, shrinks when < 0.5. You don't need to configure it.

**Q: Can I manually trigger a resize?**  
A: No need - resizes happen automatically. Current resize triggers: 100 remaps (64→256), 1000 remaps (256→1024), etc.

**Q: What's the smallest remap I can create?**  
A: Minimum is 1 block (512 bytes). Maximum is limited by spare device size.

---

## Performance

**Q: Will dm-remap slow down my I/O?**  
A: Minimal impact (~1% overhead). Hash lookup adds ~8 microseconds per operation.

**Q: Does resize impact I/O performance?**  
A: Briefly during resize (~5-10ms spike), then normal operation resumes. O(1) is maintained.

**Q: What's the throughput with dm-remap?**  
A: ~95-99% of bare device throughput. Minimal overhead from remap lookups.

**Q: How often will resizes happen?**  
A: Resizes are logarithmic. After 100,000 remaps, new resizes occur only every 100,000+ additional remaps.

**Q: Is resize frequency controllable?**  
A: Load factor thresholds are tunable in source code (default: 150 for growth, 50 for shrink). Changing not recommended.

---

## Monitoring & Observability

**Q: How do I see if resize events are happening?**  
A: Monitor kernel logs: `sudo dmesg -w | grep "Adaptive hash table"`

**Q: What does "Adaptive hash table resize: 64 -> 256 buckets (count=100)" mean?**  
A: 100 remaps triggered resize from 64 to 256 buckets. Load factor was 156% (above 150% threshold).

**Q: How much memory does dm-remap use?**  
A: ~156 bytes per remap. 100,000 remaps = ~15 MB. 1,000,000 remaps = ~150 MB.

**Q: Can I integrate dm-remap with monitoring systems (Prometheus, etc.)?**  
A: Currently through kernel logs. Native metrics export coming in v4.3.

**Q: Are resize events normal?**  
A: Yes, completely normal! They're rare and expected (logarithmic frequency).

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Module won't load**  
A: See Installation Guide troubleshooting. Usually: build tools missing, wrong kernel headers, or stale module cache.

**Q: Device creation fails with "Invalid argument"**  
A: Check: target name (should be dm-remap-v4), number of arguments (should be 2), device paths exist.

**Q: No resize events appear**  
A: Add more remaps. Resize triggers at 100 remaps (64→256 buckets). Use script: `for i in {1..150}; do dmsetup message device 0 "add_remap ..."`

**Q: Device is very slow**  
A: Check for errors in dmesg. Verify devices are on different physical disks. Profile with iostat.

**Q: Device disappeared/errors on load**  
A: Likely cause: main or spare device became unavailable. Check device paths with `ls -la /dev/loop*`

**Q: High memory usage**  
A: Check remap count. Memory scales linearly with remaps (~156 bytes each). Expected for large remap counts.

## Production Deployment

**Q: Is dm-remap production-ready?**  
A: Yes! v4.2.2 is fully tested (static + runtime + kernel-observed resize events). See RUNTIME_TEST_REPORT_FINAL.md.

**Q: What's the SLA/reliability?**  
A: Depends on underlying devices. dm-remap itself is fault-tolerant and designed for 24/7 operation.

**Q: Can I upgrade the kernel with dm-remap active?**  
A: Generally yes, but safest to: unmount → remove device → reboot → reinstall → recreate device.

**Q: What's the backup strategy?**  
A: Metadata is auto-saved in spare device (multiple redundant copies). Additional backup recommended for critical data.

**Q: Can dm-remap handle failover scenarios?**  
A: Module handles device failures transparently. If spare device fails, I/O to remap blocks will fail (logged in dmesg).

**Q: How do I migrate from v4.0 to v4.2.2?**  
A: Backup metadata → Remove device → Unload old module → Load new module → Recreate device.

---

## Architecture & Design

**Q: How does the load factor calculation work?**  
A: `load_scaled = (remap_count * 100) / hash_size`. Example: 100 remaps / 64 buckets = 156 > 150 threshold.

**Q: Why O(1) performance?**  
A: Hash table with linear probing. Collisions minimized by keeping load factor between 0.5 and 1.5.

**Q: What hash function is used?**  
A: FNV-1a for block numbers. Fast and well-distributed for integer keys.

**Q: Why 2x multiplier for resize?**  
A: Exponential growth minimizes number of resizes (logarithmic). Mathematical optimal for amortized O(1).

**Q: Is metadata persistent?**  
A: Yes, auto-saved to spare device with multiple redundant copies. Survives power loss and reboots.

## Future Features

**Q: Will dm-remap support remap removal?**  
A: Yes, v4.3 planned feature. Currently recreate device to reset.

**Q: Will there be a GUI?**  
A: No. dm-remap is kernel module. Tools may be created by community.

**Q: What's next for dm-remap?**  
A: v4.3: remap removal, metrics export, trim support. v4.4+: performance optimizations, additional features.

**Q: Can I contribute to dm-remap?**  
A: Yes! Open GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussion threads. Repository: https://github.com/amigatomte/dm-remap

## Getting Help

**Q: Where's the documentation?**  
A: Main docs: `docs/user/` directory. Specific guides in USER_GUIDE.md, INSTALLATION.md, MONITORING.md.

**Q: How do I report a bug?**  
A: GitHub Issues: https://github.com/amigatomte/dm-remap/issues

**Q: Where's the source code?**  
A: Main code: `src/dm-remap-v4-real-main.c` (~2600 lines, well-commented)

**Q: How do I run tests?**  
A: Validation: `bash tests/validate_hash_resize.sh`  
Runtime: `sudo bash tests/runtime_resize_test_fixed.sh`

---

## Performance Tuning

**Q: Should I change the load factor thresholds?**  
A: No. Current defaults (150/50) are mathematically optimal. Changing could hurt performance.

**Q: How can I speed up lookups?**  
A: They're already ~8μs (optimal). Further optimization minimal. Focus on device I/O speed instead.

**Q: What if I have very few remaps (<10)?**  
A: Still fast! O(1) applies at any scale. No performance penalty for small remap counts.

**Q: Should I use RAM disk for spare device?**  
A: Not recommended. Defeats purpose of separate physical device. Use different disk for redundancy.

---

## Common Scenarios

**Q: I have 10,000 bad blocks to remap**  
A: Perfect use case! Add via script. Expect ~4-5 resize events total. O(1) maintained throughout.

**Q: I want to test dm-remap first**  
A: Create with loopback files (see Quick Start). Test thoroughly before production.

**Q: I need transparent failover**  
A: dm-remap handles main device failures transparently. For spare failures, needs intervention (v4.3+).

**Q: I'm concerned about resize overhead**  
A: Don't be! Resizes are rare (logarithmic) and fast (~5-10ms). Total overhead over operational lifetime: negligible.
