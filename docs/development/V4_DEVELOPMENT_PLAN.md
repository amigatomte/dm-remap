# dm-remap v4.0 Development Plan - Phase 1 Focus

**Planning Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Phase 1 Target**: Q1 2026  
**Primary Features**: Background Health Scanning + Enhanced Metadata Foundation

---

## 🎯 Phase 1 Integrated Development Strategy

### **Foundation Philosophy**: Enhanced Metadata + Health Scanning
Your suggestion to add **Automatic Setup Reassembly** perfectly aligns with the metadata infrastructure needed for Background Health Scanning. We'll develop these features together as they share common metadata foundations.

## 📋 Week-by-Week Development Plan

### **Weeks 1-2: Metadata Infrastructure & Research**

#### Enhanced Metadata Format Design with Redundancy
```c
// New v4.0 metadata structure with redundant storage
struct dm_remap_metadata_v4 {
    // Header with integrity protection
    struct {
        uint32_t magic;              // Magic number: 0x444D5234
        uint64_t sequence_number;    // Monotonic counter for conflict resolution
        uint32_t header_checksum;    // CRC32 of this header
        uint32_t data_checksum;      // CRC32 of data sections
        uint32_t copy_index;         // Which copy this is (0-4)
        uint64_t timestamp;          // Creation/update timestamp
    } header;
    
    // v3.0 compatibility section
    struct dm_remap_metadata_v3 legacy;
    
    // v4.0 Configuration Storage Section
    struct {
        char main_device_uuid[37];      // UUID of main device
        char main_device_path[256];     // Original device path
        uint64_t main_device_size;      // Device size in sectors
        uint32_t target_params_len;     // Length of stored parameters
        char target_params[512];        // dm-remap target parameters
        char sysfs_config[1024];       // sysfs settings snapshot
        uint32_t config_version;       // Configuration format version
        uint32_t config_checksum;      // Configuration section CRC32
        uint8_t device_fingerprint[32]; // SHA-256 device fingerprint
    } setup_config;
    
    // v4.0 Health Scanning Section
    struct {
        uint64_t last_scan_time;       // Last background scan timestamp
        uint32_t scan_interval;        // Configured scan interval (seconds)
        uint32_t health_score;         // Overall device health (0-100)
        uint32_t sector_scan_progress; // Current scan progress (0-100)
        uint32_t scan_flags;           // Scanning configuration flags
        struct health_statistics {
            uint32_t scans_completed;
            uint32_t errors_detected;
            uint32_t predictive_remaps;
            uint32_t scan_overhead_ms;
        } stats;
    } health_data;
};
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### **Enhanced Metadata Strategy**
1. **Backward Compatibility**: v4.0 metadata includes complete v3.0 section
2. **Discovery Optimization**: Metadata placed at predictable spare device locations
3. **Safety First**: Multiple validation checks before automatic reassembly
4. **Incremental Upgrade**: Automatic v3.0 → v4.0 metadata upgrade on first v4.0 use

### **Background Health Scanning Architecture**
1. **Non-Intrusive Design**: Use idle I/O periods for scanning
2. **Configurable Intervals**: Default 24-hour full scan cycle
3. **Intelligent Scheduling**: Avoid scanning during high I/O periods
4. **Health Scoring**: Simple algorithm with room for ML enhancement in Phase 2

### **Automatic Setup Reassembly Benefits**

## 🚀 Why This Integrated Approach Works

1. **Shared Infrastructure**: Both features require enhanced metadata
2. **Complementary Value**: Discovery enables health scanning deployment
3. **Risk Management**: Two moderate-complexity features vs. one high-complexity
4. **Enterprise Focus**: Both features address enterprise deployment needs
5. **Foundation Building**: Creates infrastructure for remaining v4.0 features

## 🎯 Next Phase Preview

**Phase 2 (Q2 2026)** will build on this foundation:
- **Predictive Analysis**: Use health data collected in Phase 1
- **Multiple Spare Devices**: Leverage enhanced metadata format
- **ML Integration**: Advanced health scoring using collected data
- **Policy Engine**: Automated responses based on health and configuration data

## 💡 Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Recommended development setup
git checkout -b v4-phase1-development
mkdir -p v4_development/{metadata,health,discovery,tests}
mkdir -p documentation/v4_specifications

# Development tracking
echo "Phase 1 development started: $(date)" > V4_PHASE1_LOG.md
```

This integrated approach gives you **two complementary enterprise features** that share infrastructure while maintaining the manageable scope you need for successful Phase 1 completion.
