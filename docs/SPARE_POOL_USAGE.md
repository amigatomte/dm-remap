# dm-remap v4.0 - Spare Pool Management

## Overview

The **Spare Pool Management** feature (Priority 3) allows dm-remap to use external block devices as additional remapping capacity when internal drive spare sectors become exhausted.

## Key Features

- ✅ Manual spare device addition/removal
- ✅ First-fit allocation strategy
- ✅ Bitmap-based space tracking
- ✅ Integration with health monitoring (Priority 1)
- ✅ Persistent configuration (Priority 6)
- ✅ Simple, robust design

## When to Use Spare Pool

### Use Cases:
1. **Drive running low on spare sectors** - Add external device to extend remapping capacity
2. **Predictive replacement** - Priority 2 predicts failure, spare pool buys time until maintenance window
3. **High-value data** - Extra layer of protection beyond internal spare sectors
4. **Temporary measure** - Bridge gap until drive can be replaced

### When NOT Needed:
- Most drives have sufficient internal spare sectors
- Priority 1 + 2 give 24-48 hour warning for replacement
- Only ~5% of failure scenarios require external spares

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Spare Device

```bash
# Add a physical device as spare
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_add /dev/sdd

# Add a partition as spare
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_add /dev/sdc1

# Add LVM volume as spare
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_add /dev/mapper/vg0-spare-lv
```

### Using Loop Devices (Recommended)

```bash
# Create sparse file on any filesystem (ext4, XFS, ZFS, etc.)
mkdir -p /var/dm-remap/spares
truncate -s 10G /var/dm-remap/spares/spare001.img

# Set up loop device
losetup /dev/loop0 /var/dm-remap/spares/spare001.img

# Add to dm-remap
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_add /dev/loop0
```

### Using Loop Devices on ZFS (Get Compression + Mirroring)

```bash
# Create ZFS pool if not exists
zfs create tank/dm-remap-spares
zfs set compression=lz4 tank/dm-remap-spares
zfs set recordsize=64K tank/dm-remap-spares

# Create spare images
truncate -s 10G /tank/dm-remap-spares/spare001.img
truncate -s 10G /tank/dm-remap-spares/spare002.img

# Set up loop devices
losetup /dev/loop0 /tank/dm-remap-spares/spare001.img
losetup /dev/loop1 /tank/dm-remap-spares/spare002.img

# Add to dm-remap
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_add /dev/loop0
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_add /dev/loop1
```

Benefits:
- ✅ ZFS compression (2-10x space savings)
- ✅ ZFS mirroring/RAID-Z (redundancy)
- ✅ ZFS checksums (data integrity)
- ✅ ZFS snapshots (backup spares)
- ✅ Still filesystem-agnostic (dm-remap doesn't know/care)

### Checking Spare Pool Status

```bash
# Get statistics
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_stats

# Output:
# Spare Pool Statistics:
#   Devices: 2 total (1 available, 1 in-use, 0 full, 0 failed)
#   Capacity: 20480 MB total, 512 MB allocated, 19968 MB free
#   Allocations: 127 active, 342 lifetime
```

### Removing a Spare Device

```bash
# Remove spare (only works if not in use)
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_remove /dev/loop0

# If spare is in use, will return error:
# Error: Cannot remove spare /dev/loop0: 42 active allocations
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
1. Sector fails on /dev/sda
   ↓
2. dm-remap tries internal spare sectors
   ↓
3. If internal spares exhausted → Check spare pool
   ↓
4. Allocate from spare pool (/dev/loop0)
   ↓
5. Remap failing sector → spare device
   ↓
6. I/O continues transparently
```

### Storage Layout

```
Spare Device: /dev/loop0 (10GB = 20,971,520 sectors)
├─ Allocation Unit: 8 sectors (4KB)
├─ Total allocation units: 2,621,440
├─ Bitmap size: ~320 KB
│
Allocations:
├─ Original sector 1000 → Spare sector 0-7    (8 sectors)
├─ Original sector 5000 → Spare sector 8-15   (8 sectors)
├─ Original sector 9000 → Spare sector 16-23  (8 sectors)
└─ ... (millions of allocations possible)
```

### Integration with Other Features

**Priority 1 (Health Monitoring):**
- Monitors spare device health too
- Alerts if spare device is degrading
- Can trigger replacement of spare device

**Priority 2 (Predictive Analysis):**
- Predicts when main drive will fail
- Can proactively allocate spare capacity
- Extends time until physical replacement

**Priority 6 (Setup Reassembly):**
- Spare pool configuration persisted in metadata
- Automatically restored after reboot
- Remapping table includes spare allocations

## Performance Considerations

### Overhead

```
Best Case (SSD spare):
├─ Remapped sectors on SSD: ~0.1ms latency
├─ Potentially FASTER than original HDD
└─ Performance improvement!

Typical Case (loop device on SSD):
├─ Additional overhead: ~5-10%
├─ Total latency: ~0.5-1ms
└─ Acceptable for remapped sectors (<1% of I/O)

Worst Case (loop device on HDD):
├─ Additional overhead: ~10-20%
├─ Total latency: ~10-20ms
└─ Still acceptable (remapping is rare)
```

### Capacity Planning

```
Typical Deployment:
├─ 10x 2TB HDDs (20TB total capacity)
├─ Expected bad sectors: <0.1% over 5 years
├─ Spare pool needed: ~2GB per drive = 20GB total
└─ Recommendation: 50GB spare pool (2.5x headroom)

Cost-Effective Setup:
├─ 1x 128GB SSD partition for spare pool
├─ Create loop devices as needed
├─ Handles 50+ drives worth of remapping
└─ Cost: ~$20 (vs $500+ for dedicated spare drives)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No spare capacity available"

```bash
# Check spare pool status
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_stats

# If pool is full, add more capacity:
truncate -s 10G /var/dm-remap/spares/spare002.img
losetup /dev/loop1 /var/dm-remap/spares/spare002.img
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_add /dev/loop1
```

### Problem: "Cannot remove spare device"

```
Error means spare has active allocations.

Options:
1. Wait for allocations to be freed (if temporary)
2. Copy data to new drive and remove dm-remap device
3. Force removal (not recommended, data loss risk)
```

### Problem: Loop device performance is slow

```bash
# Check if loop device is on fast storage
losetup -a

# If on HDD, move to SSD:
mv /slow-hdd/spares/*.img /fast-ssd/spares/
# Re-create loop devices pointing to new location
```

## Comparison with Alternatives

### vs. ZFS Hot Spares

| Feature | dm-remap Spare Pool | ZFS Hot Spares |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Granularity** | Sector-level (4KB) | Entire vdev |
| **Overhead** | Minimal (<1%) | Higher (5-15%) |
| **Filesystem** | Any (ext4, XFS, etc.) | ZFS only |
| **Data Movement** | 4KB per bad sector | Entire drive resilver |
| **Complexity** | Simple | More complex |
| **Maturity** | New | Battle-tested |

### When to use dm-remap spare pool:
- Filesystem agnostic (can't use ZFS)
- Minimal overhead needed
- Sector-level granularity desired
- Predictive intelligence wanted (Priority 2)

### When to use ZFS:
- Starting fresh (no legacy constraints)
- Want integrated snapshots, compression, etc.
- Team familiar with ZFS
- Can afford higher overhead

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small, Expand as Needed

```bash
# Don't pre-allocate huge spare pool
# Start with 10-20GB, add more if needed
truncate -s 10G /var/spares/spare001.img
```

### 2. Use Loop Devices on ZFS (If Available)

```bash
# Gets compression + mirroring + checksums for free
# No dm-remap code changes needed
zfs create tank/spares
zfs set compression=lz4 tank/spares
```

### 3. Monitor Spare Pool Usage

```bash
# Check weekly/monthly
dmsetup message dm-remap-0 0 spare_stats

# If approaching full, add more capacity
```

### 4. Integrate with Monitoring

```bash
# Add to your monitoring system (Nagios, Prometheus, etc.)
# Alert if spare pool >80% full
# Alert if spare device health degrades
```

### 5. Test Before Failure

```bash
# Periodically test spare allocation
# Verify loop devices are accessible
# Check filesystem has space for expansion
```

## Future Enhancements (Not in Minimal Version)

These features are NOT implemented in the minimal Priority 3:

❌ Automatic loop device creation
❌ Predictive pool exhaustion alerts
❌ Multiple allocation policies (best-fit, round-robin, etc.)
❌ Load balancing across spares
❌ Auto-expansion based on usage trends
❌ Complex management UI

**Rationale:** Keep it simple. If users need these features, we'll add them in v4.1 based on real-world feedback.

## Conclusion

**Spare Pool Management is a "nice to have" feature:**
- Solves edge cases (~5% of failures)
- Complements existing dm-remap capabilities
- Provides manual control for admins
- Minimal code complexity (unlike full automation)

**The real value is already delivered by:**
- ✅ Priority 1: Health Monitoring (catch failures early)
- ✅ Priority 2: Predictive Analysis (24-48 hour warning)
- ✅ Priority 6: Setup Reassembly (disaster recovery)

**Use spare pool when:**
- Drive exhausts internal spare sectors (rare)
- Need to delay replacement until maintenance window
- Want extra layer of protection for critical data
