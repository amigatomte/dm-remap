### **🔧 PATH 3: HYBRID APPROACH** (Recommended)
**Timeline**: 1 week production prep + ongoing advanced development  
**Rationale**: Maximum flexibility and value delivery

#### **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Production Readiness
- Complete final production validation
- Prepare v4.0 release with current feature set
- Begin real-world deployment preparation

#### **Phase 2 (Week 2+)**: Parallel Advanced Development
- Start background health scanning development
- Gather production user feedback for priority refinement
- Iterate based on real-world usage patterns

#### **Benefits**:
- **Best of both approaches**
- **Immediate value** + **continued innovation**
- **User-driven** advanced feature prioritization
- **Sustainable development** with production feedback loop
