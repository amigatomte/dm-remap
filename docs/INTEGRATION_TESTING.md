## 🧪 Test Suite Structure

### Integration Test Cases

```
test_v4_integration.c (6 test scenarios):

1. Health Monitoring + Predictive Analysis Integration
   ├─ Health monitor detects degradation
   ├─ Predictive models analyze trend
   ├─ Forecast failure time
   └─ Trigger appropriate actions

2. Predictive Analysis + Spare Pool Integration
   ├─ Predictor forecasts failure
   ├─ Spare pool allocation prepared
   ├─ Proactive spare allocation
   └─ Ready for failure event

3. Setup Reassembly Integration
   ├─ Save all priority configurations
   ├─ Simulate system reboot
   ├─ Restore configurations
   └─ Resume operations seamlessly

4. End-to-End Real-World Scenario
   ├─ System initialization
   ├─ Normal operation
   ├─ Failure detection
   ├─ Predictive warning
   ├─ Proactive response
   ├─ Actual failure and remapping
   ├─ Configuration persistence
   └─ Reboot and restoration

5. Performance Under Combined Load
   ├─ Measure combined initialization time
   ├─ Check overhead during operations
   ├─ Verify latency targets met
   └─ Confirm CPU usage within limits

6. Error Handling and Recovery
   ├─ Invalid parameters rejected

## 🔍 Real-World Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Predictive Failure with Spare Pool

**Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Create dm-remap device
dmsetup create dm-remap-test --table "0 2097152 remap /dev/sdb 0"

# 2. Add spare device
truncate -s 10G /var/spares/spare001.img
losetup /dev/loop0 /var/spares/spare001.img
dmsetup message dm-remap-test 0 spare_add /dev/loop0

# 3. Monitor health
watch -n 1 'dmsetup status dm-remap-test'
```

**Test Flow:**
```
T+0:    System running normally
T+1h:   Health monitor detects degradation
T+2h:   Predictive model forecasts failure in 24 hours
T+3h:   Alert sent to administrator
T+24h:  Drive failure occurs
        └─> Automatic remap to spare pool
        └─> Zero downtime, zero data loss
T+25h:  Administrator replaces drive at leisure
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Failure predicted 24 hours in advance
- ✅ Spare pool allocation automatic
- ✅ No service interruption
- ✅ All data preserved

---

### Scenario 2: System Reboot Recovery

**Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Create dm-remap device with all features
dmsetup create dm-remap-test --table "0 2097152 remap /dev/sdb 0"

# 2. Configure health monitoring (via metadata)
# 3. Add spare devices
# 4. Create some remappings
```

**Test Flow:**
```
Before Reboot:
├─ Health monitoring active
├─ Predictive models trained
├─ Spare pool configured
└─ Active remappings present

Reboot:
└─> System restarts

After Reboot:
├─ dm-remap discovers devices (Priority 6)
├─ Restores metadata and configuration
├─ Health monitoring resumes
├─ Predictive models restored
├─ Spare pool allocations intact
└─ All remappings still active
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ All configurations restored automatically
- ✅ No manual intervention required
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Services resume immediately

---

### Scenario 3: Combined Stress Test

**Purpose:** Verify all priorities handle concurrent load

**Setup:**
```bash
# Create multiple dm-remap devices
for i in {0..9}; do
    dmsetup create dm-remap-$i --table "0 2097152 remap /dev/sd${i} 0"
done

# Add spare pools to each
# Configure health monitoring
# Run I/O workload
```

**Test Operations:**
```
Concurrent Operations:
├─ 10 devices with health monitoring
├─ 10 predictive models analyzing trends
├─ Multiple spare pools active
├─ Heavy I/O load on all devices
└─ Periodic metadata saves
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ System remains stable
- ✅ No resource exhaustion
- ✅ Performance within targets
- ✅ All features functional

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Integration test fails to load

```bash
# Symptom:
sudo insmod test_v4_integration.ko
# Error: could not insert module: Invalid module format

# Solution:
# Rebuild with correct kernel version
cd tests/
make clean
make

# Verify kernel version match
modinfo test_v4_integration.ko | grep vermagic
uname -r
```

#### Issue: Tests pass individually but fail integrated

```bash
# Symptom:
# Individual priority tests pass
# Integration test fails

# Diagnosis:
# Check for conflicts between priorities
dmesg | grep -E '(conflict|error|warning)'

# Common causes:
# - Shared resource contention
# - Race conditions
# - Memory allocation failures
```

#### Issue: Performance degradation

```bash
# Symptom:
# Combined overhead exceeds 2% target

# Diagnosis:
# Profile each priority's contribution
cat /proc/sys/kernel/printk  # Enable detailed logging
dmesg -w  # Watch kernel messages

# Check:
# - Health scan interval (too frequent?)
# - Predictive model count (too many?)
# - Spare pool allocation frequency
```

## 📈 Performance Benchmarking

### Benchmark Commands

```bash
# 1. Baseline (no dm-remap)
dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1000

# 2. With dm-remap (no v4 features)
dd if=/dev/mapper/dm-remap-test of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1000

# 3. With all v4 features enabled
# (health monitoring + predictive + spare pool)
dd if=/dev/mapper/dm-remap-test of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1000

# 4. Compare results
# Acceptable: <2% degradation with all features
```

### Performance Metrics to Collect
