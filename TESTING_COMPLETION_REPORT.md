# dm-remap v3.0 Testing Completion Report

**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: All test suites validated - 100% pass rate achieved

## Testing Milestone Achievement

### Phase 2 Persistence Engine - Resolution Completed
**Previous Status**: Failing with multiple test issues  
**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - 6/6 tests passing, 14/14 assertions successful

#### Issues Resolved (October 2025):

**1. Duplicate Remap Detection**
- Issue: Test using incorrect command format (3-arg vs 2-arg)
- Resolution: Fixed test to use correct `remap <sector>` format
- Validation: Now properly detects and rejects duplicate entries

**2. Device Cleanup Problems** 
- Issue: "Device or resource busy" errors during test cleanup
- Resolution: Added sync/sleep before removal with graceful fallback
- Validation: Clean device removal without errors

**3. Error Detection Accuracy**
- Issue: False positive error detection on expected initialization messages
- Resolution: Extended smart filtering across all test functions
- Validation: Only real errors detected, initialization messages ignored
