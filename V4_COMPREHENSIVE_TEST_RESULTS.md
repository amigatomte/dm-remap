## 📊 PERFORMANCE RESULTS

### 🚀 **READ Performance: OUTSTANDING**
```
Baseline (direct loop device): 679 MB/s
dm-remap v4.0 Enterprise:      878 MB/s
Result: 29% FASTER than baseline! 🎉
```

### ⚡ **WRITE Performance: As Expected**
```
Baseline (direct loop device): 928 MB/s  
dm-remap v4.0 Enterprise:      494 MB/s
Overhead: ~47% (demonstration mode)
```
