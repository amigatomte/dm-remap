# Reboot Needed - Iteration 6 (THE WORKAROUND)

## Current Status
System hung from test. Work function stuck in blocking I/O before presuspend even ran.

## What Changed (NUCLEAR OPTION)
**Root cause**: Work function is stuck in `dm_remap_write_metadata_v4()` doing synchronous I/O to spare device being removed. It got there BEFORE presuspend ran, so all our device_active checks were bypassed.

**The workaround**: **Don't call `destroy_workqueue()` at all!**
- Just NULL out the workqueue pointer
- Let the stuck work clean up when module unloads
- This leaks the workqueue, but device removal completes instantly

This is a HACK but unblocks testing. Proper fix requires refactoring metadata writes to be async/cancellable.

## After Reboot
```bash
cd /home/christian/kernel_dev/dm-remap
sudo rmmod dm-remap-v4-real 2>/dev/null || true
sudo rmmod dm-remap-v4-stats 2>/dev/null || true
sudo insmod src/dm-remap-v4-stats.ko
sudo insmod src/dm-remap-v4-real.ko

# Test device creation and removal
./tests/test_v4.0.5_baseline.sh
```

## Expected Outcome
Device removal should now complete instantly because:
1. presuspend cancels work (non-blocking)
2. presuspend frees remaps
3. destructor destroys workqueue (forces cleanup of any stuck work)
4. **No blocking waits anywhere**
