## Research Notes

### Current Research Focus
Starting with kernel work queue research and redundant metadata storage validation.

### Key Questions to Resolve
1. What is the optimal work queue configuration for background health scanning?
2. How can we ensure <2% I/O performance impact?
3. What are the best practices for multi-level checksum validation?
4. How should we handle sequence number overflow (64-bit counter)?
5. What device fingerprinting method provides best reliability?

### Research Resources
- Linux kernel source: `/usr/src/linux/`
- Device mapper source: `/usr/src/linux/drivers/md/`
- Crypto API documentation: `/usr/src/linux/crypto/`
- Block layer documentation: `/usr/src/linux/block/`
