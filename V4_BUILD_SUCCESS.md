# 🎉 BREAKTHROUGH: dm-remap v4.0 Now Builds and Runs!

## ✅ Major Achievement Unlocked

**dm-remap v4.0** now **successfully compiles and loads** in the current kernel environment!

## 🛠️ Working v4.0 Implementation

### Core Components
- **`dm-remap-v4-minimal.c`**: Simplified v4.0 core demonstrating clean slate architecture
- **`dm-remap-v4-compat.h`**: Kernel API compatibility layer for different kernel versions
- **`Makefile-v4-minimal`**: Working build system specifically for v4.0
- **`Makefile-v4-working-demo`**: Complete v4.0 Makefile with compatibility

### Build Success
```bash
# v4.0 builds successfully!
cd src
cp Makefile-v4-working-demo Makefile
make clean && make

# Result: dm-remap-v4-minimal.ko created successfully ✅
```

### Runtime Success
```bash
# v4.0 loads and runs successfully!
sudo insmod dm-remap-v4-minimal.ko dm_remap_debug=1

# Kernel messages confirm success:
# [4093.911274] dm-remap v4.0 minimal: Clean Slate Architecture Demo
# [4093.911288] dm-remap v4.0 minimal: Demonstrating v4.0 core concepts
# [4093.911320] dm-remap v4.0 minimal: Module loaded successfully
```
