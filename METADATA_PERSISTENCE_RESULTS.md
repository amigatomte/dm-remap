# Metadata Persistence Test Results
## dm-remap v4.0.3 - October 16, 2025

### Test Objective
Verify that dm-remap can survive module unload/reload cycles while preserving data integrity.

### Test Configuration
- **Main device**: Loop device (100MB sparse file)
- **Spare device**: Loop device (50MB sparse file)
- **Device stack**: dm-remap ‚Üí dm-flakey ‚Üí loop device
- **Error injection**: dm-flakey with `error_reads` feature initially enabled
- **Test data**: 5 sectors written with unique markers (1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 10000)

### Test Procedure

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Created loop devices from sparse files
   - Loaded dm-remap-v4-stats.ko and dm-remap-v4-real.ko
   - Created dm-flakey with error injection enabled
   - Created dm-remap device on top of dm-flakey

2. **Data Write Phase**
   - Wrote unique test data to 5 sectors
   - Attempted reads to trigger error detection (dm-flakey in error mode)
   - Recorded initial device status

3. **Module Reload Phase**
   - Suspended dm-remap device (flush metadata)
   - Resumed device
   - Removed dm-remap device
   - Unloaded both kernel modules (real, then stats)
   - Waited 2 seconds
   - Reloaded modules (stats, then real)
   - Recreated dm-remap device with same parameters

4. **Verification Phase**
   - Reconfigured dm-flakey to healthy mode (no error injection)
   - Attempted to read all 5 test sectors
   - Verified data integrity

### Results

#### Initial State (Before Reload)
```
Status: 0 204800 dm-remap-v4 v4.0-phase1.4 /dev/mapper/flakey_persist /dev/loop20 304 5 0 0 0 309 ...
Statistics:
  total_remaps: 0
  total_reads: 304
  total_writes: 5
  total_errors: 0
```

#### After Reload
```
Status: 0 204800 dm-remap-v4 v4.0-phase1.4 /dev/mapper/flakey_persist /dev/loop20 49 0 0 0 0 49 ...
Statistics:
  total_remaps: 0
  total_reads: 49
  total_writes: 0
  total_errors: 0
```

#### Data Integrity Verification
```
‚úì Sector 1000:  Data preserved! ("test_data_1000")
‚úì Sector 2000:  Data preserved! ("test_data_2000")
‚úì Sector 3000:  Data preserved! ("test_data_3000")
‚úì Sector 5000:  Data preserved! ("test_data_5000")
‚úì Sector 10000: Data preserved! ("test_data_10000")

Result: 5/5 sectors verified (100% data integrity)
```

### Key Findings

#### ‚úÖ PASS: Data Integrity Preserved
- **All written data was successfully read back** after module reload
- Data persisted across:
  - Module unload/reload cycle
  - Device removal/recreation
  - 2-second delay between operations
  
This demonstrates that:
1. **Data writes are successfully committed** to the underlying storage
2. **Device stacking works correctly** (dm-remap ‚Üí dm-flakey ‚Üí loop)
3. **Module lifecycle is clean** (proper cleanup and initialization)

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE: No Remapping Occurred
- No actual bad sector remapping occurred during this test
- `total_remaps: 0` before and after reload
- dm-flakey may not have triggered errors (or errors were handled differently)
- **This doesn't affect the data integrity test**, which passed successfully

#### üîç Observations: Statistics Reset
- Statistics counters reset after module reload (expected behavior)
- Before: 304 reads, 5 writes
- After: 49 reads, 0 writes
- This is **normal** - stats module doesn't persist counters across module reload
- Only metadata (remap tables) should persist, not runtime statistics

### What This Test Proves

‚úÖ **Data written through dm-remap is durable**
   - Survives module unload/reload
   - Accessible after device recreation
   
‚úÖ **Module cleanup is proper**
   - No kernel panics or oops
   - Devices can be safely removed and recreated
   
‚úÖ **Device stacking is stable**
   - dm-remap works correctly on top of dm-flakey
   - Multi-layer dm stack is functional

### What This Test Does NOT Prove

‚ùå **Remap table persistence**
   - No actual remaps were created to test persistence
   - Would need to trigger actual bad sector remapping
   - Then verify remaps survive reload

‚ùå **Metadata module integration**
   - dm-remap-v4-metadata.ko was not loaded in this test
   - Metadata persistence may require the metadata module
   - Current test only shows data durability, not remap metadata

‚ùå **Reboot persistence**
   - System reboot was not tested
   - Would need metadata module for boot-time reassembly

### Recommendations for Production

Based on these results, for production use:

1. **Load dm-remap-v4-metadata.ko** for persistent remap tables
   - Current test shows data integrity without metadata module
   - Metadata module likely needed for remap table persistence

2. **Test with actual remapping**
   - Create a test with verified bad sector remapping
   - Verify remap entries persist across reload
   - Confirm remapped sectors still redirect to spare

3. **Test reboot persistence**
   - Create remaps
   - Reboot system
   - Verify remaps are restored automatically
   - Requires dm-remap-v4-setup-reassembly.ko

4. **Test at scale**
   - 1000+ remap entries
   - Multiple reload cycles
   - Long-running stability

### Conclusion

**Test Result: ‚úÖ PASS (Data Integrity)**

While no actual remap metadata persistence was tested (no remaps occurred), the fundamental data integrity test passed with **100% success**:

- All data written through dm-remap was preserved
- Module reload cycle completed without errors
- Device recreation successful
- 5/5 test sectors verified

**Next Step**: Repeat test with:
1. dm-remap-v4-metadata.ko loaded
2. Forced error injection to create actual remaps
3. Verification that remap entries persist

This test validates that dm-remap's basic I/O path is solid and data-safe, which is a critical foundation for metadata persistence.
